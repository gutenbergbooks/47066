<h2><a name="THE_HIGH-METTLED_RACER" id="THE_HIGH-METTLED_RACER">THE HIGH-METTLED RACER.</a></h2>



<p><span class="smcap">At</span> Cooke's well-known travelling Circus there
may be seen some remarkable performances with
horses and small ponies that have been trained
for the purpose. In London, at Hengler's Cirque,
as it is called, there is a fine stud of horses, which
commands general admiration. Without depreciating
modern establishments of this kind, our
recollections go back to Astley's Amphitheatre,
near Westminster Bridge, as it used to be thirty
to forty years ago, under the management of the
late Mr Ducrow. The feats there performed by
some of the horses were exceedingly wonderful.
The animals seemed to possess a degree of human
intelligence. They were accomplished actors. Their
powers of simulation with a view to entertain
spectators went far beyond what any one could
expect whose knowledge is confined to the ordinary
class of horses. We will mention a few
particulars regarding the horses at Astley's as they
occur to our memory.</p>

<p>One evening the performance represented a
house on fire. All the inhabitants of the dwelling
had managed to escape except a lady in
an upper story. You saw her at a window
throwing about her arms wildly, and screaming
for help. Her appeals to the assembled crowd
beneath were heart-rending. The firemen could
not reach her, for the stair was seemingly in a
blaze, and there was no fire-escape. The spectators
in the theatre were wrought up to an agony, it
being but too evident that the poor lady was
doomed to perish by a painful and violent death.
In the midst of the commotion, a horse which
belonged to the lady rushed upon the stage. In
its stable it had heard the screams of its mistress,
and hastened to do its best to save her. Without
saddle or bridle, it was seen to rush into the house,
and to climb the stair amidst flames and volumes
of smoke. It reached the apartment where the
lady was. She mounted on its back, holding
by the mane, and the horse descending the stair
brought her safely to the ground. Prolonged
shouts of applause rewarded the hazardous exploit.
The whole thing was a beautiful piece of acting,
evoking throughout sentiments of pleasure and
admiration. Nothing but kindness and long
training could have made the horse so clever in
knowing what to do and to do it well. The feat
was the more surprising as horses usually have a
dread of fire which is not easily conquered. It
will be understood that the fire had been so
adroitly managed as to effect no injury on the
theatre, and that there never had been any real
danger.</p>

<p>On another evening at Astley's a still more
remarkable piece of acting by a white horse
named Prince, was offered for public entertainment.
It was in a play called the High-mettled
Racer. The play was in several successive acts,
and designed to represent different stages of degradation
in the career of a horse from youth to old
age. The spectacle was painful but touching, and
unfortunately in too many cases true to nature.
We shall endeavour to describe some of the scenes.</p>

<p>When the piece opens, we have a view of an
English country mansion. In front there are
several mounted huntsmen in scarlet coats ready
to set out on a fox-chase. They are waiting till a
young lady comes out of the mansion to accompany
them. We see the lady, who is properly equipped
for riding, descend the steps at the doorway, and
by the aid of a groom mount a young and beautifully
shaped white horse that is in readiness for
her. She speaks to it affectionately, and calls it
her dear Prince. The elegant form of the animal,
its proud bearing, its glossy coat, and the spirited
way it prances about, excite general admiration.
After a little galloping to shew its paces, the horse
with its fair rider goes off with the huntsmen and
hounds in pursuit of a fox&mdash;that was also a taught
actor in its way&mdash;which leads the party through
a variety of difficulties, such as climbing up rocks,
leaping over hedges, and so forth, till at length,
when on the point of being run down, it dashes
into the cottage of a poor old woman, who humanely
gives it shelter. She takes up the fox lovingly in
her arms, and saves it from seemingly impending
destruction. That may be called the first stage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">{210}</a></span>
in the horse's career, during which Prince was
well attended to and happy.</p>

<p>At the beginning of next act, the horse is to
appearance several years older, and is no longer fit
for racing or hunting. The lady, its first owner,
had from some circumstances been compelled to
part with it. From its swiftness in running, it
had been purchased to run at celebrated horse-races,
at which it had on several occasions won
prizes, and its sprightliness obtained for it the
name of the High-mettled Racer. After this it
was transferred from one owner to another, always
in a descending scale, until poor Prince is seen
in the condition of a cab-horse in the streets of
London. It has somewhat the look of its former
state, but is terribly broken down in figure and
spirit. Its plump and glossy appearance is gone.
It is dirty and dejected. It hangs its head droopingly
down. Its ribs shine through its skin. Its
joints are stiff. It stands on three legs, with the
other leg resting on the point of the foot, just as
we see cab-horses trying to rest their aching limbs
when standing in a row for hire. What a wretched
downcome from that which Prince had enjoyed in
'life's young dream!' There awaits it, however, a
still lower depth of misery.</p>

<p>In the following act, Prince is reduced to the
forlorn condition of drawing a sand-cart, when it
can hardly draw its own legs after it. To appearance,
it is half-starved. A child offers it a few
straws, which it is glad to eat. It seems to be
little better than skin and bone. The cart in
which it is yoked belongs to a rude jobber whose
object is to wring the utmost possible work out of
the animal before selling it to be killed. A feeling
of horror and compassion thrills through the
spectators. They can hardly believe they are only
looking at a play, for the simulation is perfect.
Staggering along with its draught under the cruel
urging of the whip, the moment arrives when
Prince can go no further. Its unhappy span of
life is terminated. It suddenly drops down under
its weary load&mdash;to die, and be relieved of all its
troubles. Unyoked from the cart, and relieved of
its harness, there it is stretched out, with a crowd
of idlers about it, seemingly at the last gasp, and
offering in its fate a dreadful instance of undeserved
cruelty to animals. 'Man's inhumanity to
man makes countless thousands mourn.' Quite
true; but, alas, inhumanity to man is nothing in
comparison with the inhumanity which is recklessly
exercised towards the horse.</p>

<p>There is a concluding scene in the life of the
horse we have been describing, which must on no
account be omitted. While lying in the street in
its death-struggle, and when preparations were
making to drag it off to the shambles, a lady who
is passing recognises the dying animal as being her
favourite horse Prince, which she had ridden years
ago at the fox-chase. At the same time the poor
beast faintly lifting its head, recognises its old
mistress, and with failing eyes seems to implore
her compassion. In a state of distraction, the lady
kneels down, takes the horse's head in her lap,
speaks to it consolingly, and once more calls it
her dear Prince. Oh, what she would not do to
revive the dying animal, and give Prince a new
lease of existence! Just at this juncture, in the
manner of the old plays, when something supernatural
was required to get over a serious difficulty,
a sylph-like being in the character of a
benevolent fairy appears on the stage carrying a
magic wand. Her mission, she says, being to
redress wrong, she touches the dying horse with
the wand and bids it rise. In an instant Prince
starts up from its recumbent position, and to the
delight and amazement of everybody, it is as
fresh, plump, glossy, and beautiful as when it went
out with the hounds in the fox-chase. The lady
springs upon its back, and off Prince goes at a
splendid gallop. The applause was, of course,
immense!</p>

<p>Perhaps in the whole annals of horsemanship
there was never demonstrated a more wonderful
case of acting. The horse had all along been
feigning for public amusement. It had feigned
to be a cab-horse. It had feigned to be tired
when it stood on three legs. It feigned to be
dying when it dropped down in the sand-cart.
The whole affair was a piece of simulation, and
by means of some adventitious aid in discolouring
the skin, the deception was complete. A hasty
rub with a cloth puts it all to rights; and instead
of dying, Prince gallops off in the consciousness of
having performed a brilliant piece of acting.</p>

<p>What we have narrated from recollection will
assist in illustrating the natural intelligence of the
horse, and the extent to which it can be educated
by patient and gentle training. Harsh treatment
would be all a mistake. Words kindly spoken,
some small reward in the shape of a mouthful
of what is agreeable&mdash;a trifling sweetmeat, for
instance&mdash;will work wonders in forming the character
of the horse, and teaching it to perform any
required feat. We have always thought that
an impressive moral lesson was conveyed in the
play of the High-mettled Racer.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_LAST_OF_THE_HADDONS" id="THE_LAST_OF_THE_HADDONS">THE LAST OF THE HADDONS.</a></h2>

<p class='p3'>CHAPTER XVII.&mdash;MRS TIPPER TO THE RESCUE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was the gravest reason for anxiety respecting
Lilian's future. Marian at her very best, and
with the strongest motive for making herself agreeable
to Lilian, had never been a companion for
her; and now! Would it be possible for Lilian
to remain at Fairview for even the three or four
months until Philip's return? I had very grave
doubts upon the point.</p>

<p>That Marian was better than she had appeared
when she first became acquainted with her good
fortune, I am bound to acknowledge. Although
she had at first seen the question entirely from
one point of view, it presently became evident
that she was not lacking in a certain kind of
good-nature, which, in my prejudice against her, I
had not given her credit for being capable of.
Evidently she now meant to be kind and considerate,
and to act generously, according to her
light. Indeed I think she flattered herself that
nothing could be more amiable and generous than
was her demeanour towards Lilian, the morning
after the revelation had been made. If Lilian found
her graciousness hard to bear, she did not blame
Marian for it. She came to meet Lilian with a
kiss, as the latter entered the breakfast-room, and
was altogether a great deal more than usually affectionate
in her morning greeting. Moreover, she
made some effort to keep her delight, at the discovery
which had been made, as much out of sight
as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">{211}</a></span></p>

<p>As yet it was only in Marian's altered bearing
towards the servants that the effect which the
change in her position had upon her could be
seen. She had many a time expressed her opinion
that Lilian was not sufficiently dignified in her
bearing towards her inferiors, and she was now
shewing us what she considered to be the proper
deportment of a mistress; though the effect was
somewhat marred by their reception of it.</p>

<p>But it did me real good to see the fealty of one
and all to Lilian. That Marian should at once
pass to the head of the table was, I suppose, under
the circumstances, to be expected; and neither
Mrs Tipper nor Lilian appeared in the slightest
degree annoyed by it; both, perhaps, too much
absorbed to care where they sat. But I was somewhat
amused to find that the arrangement of the
breakfast things was swiftly altered; and so far
as the replacing the urn, cups and saucers, and so
forth went, where Lilian sat was made the head
of the table. Marian looked very indignant and
rather foolish; but she could not very well protest
at that moment.</p>

<p>I am afraid I did a little enjoy witnessing her
mortification, when Marian found that Lilian was
treated with as much deference as though she
were a queen, and invariably served before herself.
Saunders, indeed, made quite a demonstration of
obeying Lilian's slightest glance; whilst the new
power was very indifferently waited upon by his
subordinate. It was no use giving orders; Saunders
was deaf and dumb and blind, so far as Marian
was concerned. He could not, and would not,
look over her indecent haste in stepping into
his beloved young mistress's place; and as I
afterwards found, he had made up his mind to
leave Fairview immediately the change that had
taken place was made known; and having Lilian
to refer to for a character, was independent of
Marian's patronage, and took delight in shewing
that he was.</p>

<p>Lilian's past kindness to them was beginning to
bear fruit amongst the servants. Every one in the
house seemed desirous to prove their love and
sympathy with her now. She had informed me
that she meant to lose no time in putting Marian
in possession, and very quickly proved that she
was in earnest. As soon as we four were alone
together in the morning-room, she quietly began,
looking a great deal more self-possessed than the
Lilian of yesterday:</p>

<p>'I do not know precisely what has to be done;
but I suppose some legal form has to be gone
through to put you in possession of&mdash;your&mdash;rights,
Marian; I have therefore telegraphed for the solicitor.
He will tell you what has to be done;
and I hope it may be got through as quickly as
possible, for all our sakes.'</p>

<p>'Well, dear, I leave all that to you. I don't
want to hurry you; no one could behave more
kindly about it than you have, for I'm sure it
must be dreadful to have to give up all&mdash;&mdash; But
there; of course you will live here with me,'
added Marian, in an outburst of good-nature. 'I'll
give you as much as you meant to give me,
and'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Pray'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'But I must say it, dear. I am not going to
forget all your kindness to me. No one shall be
able to say that I have not behaved generously.'</p>

<p>'I am sure you mean well,' returned Lilian,
shrinking nervously under the generosity. 'But
I do not as yet quite know what I shall do. Of
course Auntie and Mary and I must be together,
and we none of us mind being poor. Perhaps
Mary and I could try opening a little school?'&mdash;with
a glance towards me.</p>

<p>'We shall contrive to get on very well, dearie,'
was my cheerful little rejoinder.</p>

<p>Marian was about to protest; but Lilian gravely
went on: 'If I can in any way do without accepting
your&mdash;kindness, you must excuse my saying that I
prefer independence.'</p>

<p>No mention, I believe no thought of Arthur
Trafford in connection with her future life. She
seemed to realise that if he had not already
deserted her he would do so very shortly: it was
only a question of time.</p>

<p>'Oh, you mustn't talk like that, you know!'
said Marian; 'you mustn't, really. It sounds like
pride; and why should you be too proud to take
an allowance, when I was not? At anyrate you
must, and shall, take as much as Pa used to allow
me&mdash;two hundred a year, you know;' with the air
of feeling that she was acting very largely.</p>

<p>'Please excuse me now; I have something to
attend to up-stairs,' said Lilian, moving towards
the door. 'Come, Mary.'</p>

<p>I promptly rose to accompany her. Marian
looked as though her good-nature was becoming
exhausted.</p>

<p>'Oh, by-the-bye, stop a moment, Miss Haddon.
I shall not be in need of a companion; at least, if
I have one, I should like to choose for myself; so
perhaps, under the circumstances, you will not
require a long notice. You couldn't expect it;
and'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'I shall not require any notice whatever from
you,' was my cheerful rejoinder. 'My engagement
was with Miss Farrar.'</p>

<p>'You forget <i>I</i> am Miss Farrar.'</p>

<p>'You will very often have to put up with my
forgetfulness upon that point while I remain at
Fairview,' was my mental comment. But I gravely
informed her that she need have no fears about
my being troublesome in any way.</p>

<p>Mrs Tipper had been silent during our conversation,
apparently thinking over some little plan
of her own; but she rose at once to accompany
Lilian and me, no way deterred by Marian's protests.
For the first time I noticed a quiet dignity
in her bearing, which sat extremely well upon her,
as she said: 'My place is by the side of my dear
Lilian.'</p>

<p>As I had expected, an early train brought
Arthur Trafford, eager to recommence his efforts
to persuade Lilian to fall in with his wishes; and
perhaps not without hope that, now she had had
time to realise what the giving up would really be,
he would find her more plastic in his hands. As I
have said, such as it was, his love was sincere&mdash;only
one thing seemed worse than losing her; and he
would not lose her without a desperate struggle.
He came, prepared to exert all his powers of
persuasion. Her firmness, or obstinacy as he
chose to call it, had quite taken him by surprise,
and he could not as yet believe in it, being more
inclined to ascribe it to temper than to conviction.
He met with a little rebuff in the outset, in her
unwillingness to see him alone. He had been
shewn into the library, where she was sitting with
Mrs Tipper and me; and in reply to his invitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">{212}</a></span>
to go elsewhere, she had murmured something
about preferring to remain there. As he could
not very well request Mrs Tipper and me to leave
them, and we ourselves made no attempt to do so,
having, in fact, exchanged a glance which meant
not leaving Lilian without orders, he was obliged
to put up with our presence.</p>

<p>He found her quite as unmanageable upon the
one point as she had been the evening before;
and in his disappointment and mortification, laid
bare his own motives more than he was conscious
of doing. And terrible as it was for her at the
moment, I was even glad she should see him as he
really was. Better that her love should be killed
at one blow, since it had to be killed, than by
the slow torture which a more gradual unveiling
would have entailed.</p>

<p>As she shrank back, gazing at him with dilated
eyes and white face, I knew that she had at last
awakened to the truth. <i>This</i> was not the hero
she had worshipped&mdash;a man whose capacity for
doing great deeds only lacked opportunity for its
development. He could not help shewing us
what it was which he most felt the loss of.</p>

<p>Then he was impolitic enough to attack me
before her; something more than insinuating that
I was the marplot who had come between him
and his happiness. In his heat, he could not
perceive that if I were really what he accused me
of being, he was paying Lilian a very bad compliment
in declaring that she was completely
under my influence.</p>

<p>'You cannot deny that you have encouraged her
in this!' he angrily exclaimed, turning upon me.
'You dare not say that you have not!'</p>

<p>'I dare to say that I honestly think she has
done what is right, and would do it though the
whole world turned its back upon her; and I am
proud to be considered her friend, Mr Trafford.'</p>

<p>'My only one!' sobbed Lilian, clinging to me.</p>

<p>'No, indeed. Every one who respects truth
and unselfishness, must be your friend, dear
Lilian.'</p>

<p>'I am sure Mrs Tipper will be more open to
reason!' he hotly ejaculated, turning towards her,
as she sat regarding him very attentively. 'You,
madam, will not, I am sure, desire to see your
brother's wishes so disregarded.'</p>

<p>But he had revealed himself to her as well as
to us, and found Mrs Tipper also was on Lilian's
side. Indeed she came out quite grandly. If, as
I suspected, he had hitherto attributed her amiability
to want of character, he could do so no longer.
She was worthy of being Lilian's aunt; and not
at all unlike her niece, allowing for the difference
in early training. There was a grave quiet dignity
in her tone and bearing as she expressed her entire
approval of the step Lilian had taken, which
appeared to quite take him by surprise.</p>

<p>'I thought you loved Lilian, Mrs Tipper.'</p>

<p>'I do love her, Mr Trafford; more than ever,
since she has shewn me that not even her love
for you can turn her aside from doing what she
believes to be right.'</p>

<p>But its being right was just what he would not
for a moment allow, and he again and again went
over the same arguments, now pleading, now reviling,
still unwilling to believe in the utter
uselessness of it all. 'It was all very well now,
in the first flush, of thinking she was doing a
generous action; but how would it be by-and-by,
when she found herself penniless and dependent
upon the bounty of another, and that other
Marian Reed? A nice thing to be patronised
and walked over by a girl like that!' and so
forth, in the one-sided, unreasoning way with
which people who have a special end in view are
apt to talk, basing his arguments upon the consequences
which might ensue from the act, instead
of upon the right or wrong of committing it.</p>

<p>'My dear Lilian will not be dependent upon
Miss&mdash;Marian's bounty, nor will she be penniless
or homeless, Mr Trafford,' said Mrs Tipper. 'I
did not like to mention it until I was quite sure;
but I have made inquiries, and Mr Markham tells
me that the two hundred a year which was placed
to my account was settled upon me by my brother
after my husband's death. I recollect Jacob telling
me, when I first came to live at Fairview,
that he had made me independent; but I did not
understand it as I do now. Of course my dear
Lilian and Mary will share it with me.'</p>

<p>What a relief it was to hear this, for Lilian's
sake. It had been so painful to think of her being
obliged to be dependent upon Marian, even for a
time. And how hearty, though at the moment
only expressed by a look, was my gratitude to the
dear little woman for her kindness and consideration
for me. She did not know that I only needed
her love. I had received fifty pounds for my
salary, and that would more than suffice to keep
me until Philip's return; but it did me real good
to know that she was not aware of my prospects,
when she so generously included me with Lilian
in the offer of a home.</p>

<p>Lilian got through the pitiful scene with her
quondam lover better, on the whole, than she had
done the night before. His threat, once more used
in the heat of the moment (I did not give him
credit for seriously entertaining the idea, as yet),
to the effect that her act would part them, was
acquiesced in; not angrily, nor defiantly&mdash;with no
attempt to conceal the pain it cost her, but acquiesced
in. He might come again and again and
threaten as he pleased; it would be no use now.
Moreover, I had the comfort of believing that,
bitter as the suffering was to her, it would not be
of long duration. Though she as yet knew it not,
he had not the power to shadow her future life.
In truth he was likely to suffer a great deal more
than she was. Say what he might, he estimated
her more highly than he had ever done before.
The very decision which he so complained of
raised her in his estimation; whilst all the
glamour was gone from him in her eyes now.</p>

<p>He left no stone unturned whilst it was still not
too late, and brought his sister to assist him. Both,
I saw, attributed a great deal of blame to me in
the matter; and both were now candid enough to
give more expression to their antagonism than
they had previously done. But their antagonism I
had no right whatever to complain of, since my
estimation of them was not higher than theirs of
me.</p>

<p>Mrs Chichester was in a somewhat awkward
position. She had the gravest reasons for doing
her best to further her brother's wishes, and was
at the same time very desirous of keeping in
Robert Wentworth's good graces. All her diplomatic
powers were brought into play; and she had
the mortification of perceiving that it was all to
no purpose. It was almost amusing to see her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">{213}</a></span>
assuring Mr Wentworth, with tearful eyes and
clasped hands, that whatever others might think,
she meant to uphold her dearest Lilian; in
contrast with certain little speeches addressed
to Marian, which occasionally met my ears. One
thing was evident, she did not wish to get out of
favour with the new power.</p>

<p>There was no fencing between the two men. A
sharp hand-to-hand encounter for a few moments,
and then friendship lay dead. Robert Wentworth
had spoken his mind; and the other had declared
that from thenceforth all friendship was over
between them.</p>

<p>Arthur Trafford was in some measure perhaps
to be pitied, at this crisis of his life. Enervated
by a life of luxury and indolence, he probably
lacked the power to put his shoulder to the
wheel, and try to earn a living for himself and
Lilian. Supposing the idea to have crossed his
mind, and he was not so utterly worthless that it
may not have done so, he must have realised
what terribly uphill work it would be to commence
the struggle for a livelihood at eight-and-twenty,
and with no special aptitude or preparation
for any profession. He had lost all: the girl
he loved? her fortune, and his friend; and I will
do him the justice to say that the loss of Robert
Wentworth's friendship was no light trouble to
him, though he himself had cast it off. He was
a poorer man than I had imagined him to be;
having, in fact, lived upon the principal of the
small sum left him by his father, and depending
upon his marriage with Lilian for future supply.</p>

<p>I was heartily glad when the matter was in Mr
Markham's hand, and so far placed beyond dispute;
after which we were for a short time left
undisturbed by Arthur Trafford and his sister.
But one visitor made her appearance at Fairview,
who occasioned Marian not a little mortification,
of which I was an unwilling witness. It was the
third morning after the discovery had been made
known. Lilian, who spent most of her time in
her own room with Mrs Tipper, had asked me to
bring her a book from the drawing-room. I
entered the room, and had just reached the table
where I was to find the book, when the sound of
half-suppressed sobbing warned me that I was
intruding upon some one; and glancing round,
I was astonished to see Marian seated on one of
the couches, and the figure of a homely-looking
woman kneeling at her feet, with her hands raised
as if in supplication, and tears streaming from her
eyes. In another moment I recognised Mrs Pratt;
and hastily catching up the book I wanted,
turned to quit the room, quite as much averse to
intrude as they could desire me to be. But Mrs
Pratt had recognised me, and entreated me to stay
and try to help her.</p>

<p>'You are the lady who came with Miss Farrar
that day. Do, pray ma'am, try what you can to
persuade Miss Reed not to injure the dear young
lady, who has been so good to her.'</p>

<p>'I am afraid I have no power to do so, Mrs
Pratt,' I returned.</p>

<p>'Really, aunt, I little thought <i>this</i> would be
the consequence of my telling you about my good
fortune. It doesn't seem natural to take it in that
way, it really doesn't! I made sure you had come
to see the place and congratulate me, and I had
you shewn in here on purpose that you might see
for yourself. But instead of being glad, you behave
like this, wanting me to give it all up, and before
Miss Haddon too!'</p>

<p>'You know what I have told you; pray, think
better of it, Miss Reed, dear.'</p>

<p>I had reached the door again, when Mrs Pratt's
words caused me to pause, my pulses throbbing a
little more rapidly than usual. What if there
were in truth some bar to Marian's right, and Mrs
Pratt knew it? I waited.</p>

<p>'What you have told me is no reason for giving
up what belongs to me,' angrily returned Marian.
'And I must once more remind you that I am
Miss Farrar now.'</p>

<p>'It <i>is</i> a reason, and a good one. I have told you
why your mother would never have made use of
that paper; and if you turn against that sweet
young lady, who was so good to you, nothing but
sorrow will come of it.'</p>

<p>'It's all nonsense saying Ma would not have
made use of it. How could she, when Pa had the
paper in his own possession?'</p>

<p>'I believe he only had it amongst the letters
and papers she wished to be sent him after her
death. She would never have used it if she had
known it was legal, because&mdash;you force me to say
so&mdash;she knew that she was not worthy to be
called his wife!'</p>

<p>'You are very cruel and wicked to say such
things; and you shall not go on!' ejaculated
Marian, with flaming cheeks. 'A pretty sister you
must be to talk in that way!'</p>

<p>Mrs Pratt wrung her hands, crying bitterly: 'I
loved her through it all; she knew I did; and I've
done my duty by you; but I cannot see that
dear young lady turned out of house and home,
without'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Good gracious, aunt, how you talk! As
though I were going to turn her out of house and
home, when Miss Haddon knows how generously I
have behaved, if she would acknowledge it!'</p>

<p>I took Mrs Pratt's hand in mine, and looking
into her eyes, solemnly asked: 'Will you tell me
the truth, Mrs Pratt? Was there anything in
your sister's life which prevented her marriage
with Mr Farrar being a legal one?'</p>

<p>'I can't say so much as that, Miss&mdash;she wasn't
married to anybody else; but he knew, and
she knew, that she was not worthy to claim a
wife's'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'That's quite enough, aunt,' interrupted Marian.
'They are my rights; and I've told you over and
over again that I don't mean to give my rights up.
It looks as if you were envious of my good fortune&mdash;it
really does. Not that it will make any difference
to me in what I mean to do by-and-by,' she
added largely. 'I intend to make you and Mr
Pratt a handsome allowance; and some of these
days Susy shall come down and see Fairview.'</p>

<p>'Not a penny; your uncle and me wouldn't
take a penny of the money, if we were starving!'</p>

<p>'Ah, you will think better of it by-and-by,'
complacently returned Marian. 'And you won't
find that I shall draw back from my word. Your
behaviour to-day won't make any difference to
me, though some people wouldn't notice you again
after it.'</p>

<p>Mrs Pratt drew her shawl about her with
trembling hands, and turned towards the door.</p>

<p>'Don't go away like that, aunt. You haven't
seen anything. Let me shew you the conservatory,
and the'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">{214}</a></span></p>

<p>But Mrs Pratt hurried out of the room, and was
gone before Marian could prevent her. The latter
stood for a moment looking doubtfully at me,
then said a little consciously: 'I suppose it's no
use asking you not to mention what aunt said,
Miss Haddon?'</p>

<p>'It would be no use, if my mentioning it would
be of any service to Lilian,' I replied. 'But as I
do not wish to give her unnecessary pain, I will
not tell her&mdash;at anyrate for the present.'</p>

<p>'Nor Mrs Tipper?'</p>

<p>'No; unless I at any time see more necessity
for telling her than I do now,' I said, as I
quitted the room.</p>

<p>I was not a little disturbed by what Mrs Pratt
had revealed. It seemed doubly hard that Lilian's
mother should be displaced by a woman whom
her own sister acknowledged to be unworthy of
the name of wife. In my anxiety, I put a few
cautious words to Mr Markham in a few minutes'
<i>tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte</i> I contrived during one of his visits; but
I only got a few cautious words in return, and the
information that the Scotch marriage was undoubtedly
a legal one.</p>

<p>Meantime I was more than once obliged to
remind Marian that she was not mistress of Fairview
until the legal formalities were gone through
which should put her in possession. She had at
once commenced to assume the dignity of the position,
and did not hesitate to call the servants to
order when they became too openly oblivious of
it. Nor, indeed, did she hesitate to point it out to
Lilian, when the latter for a moment forgot the
change in her position, and gave some little order
to the servants. But with Lilian it was only a
momentary and quite natural forgetfulness. Her
reign had hitherto been so supreme and undisputed
at Fairview, that she could not all at once
get accustomed to the altered aspect of affairs.
But her apologies were very graciously accepted.</p>

<p>'Don't say a word, dear; it's a wonder you
don't forget oftener. And I'm sure no one could
be nicer than you are about it, no one!' And she
was candid enough to add: 'I'm not sure that I
should have taken it so well as you do myself,
though I know how to behave as well as most
people; and no one shall say I can't be generous
now.'</p>

<p>I believe that she did honestly try to be what
she considered generous. But her conception of
generosity! Poor Lilian found Marian's generosity
and good-nature a great deal harder to bear
than her reverses just now.</p></div>

<h2><a name="A_WALK_ACROSS_AFRICA" id="A_WALK_ACROSS_AFRICA">A WALK ACROSS AFRICA.</a></h2>




<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the first Livingstone Search Expedition
in Africa had come to an untimely end, a second
was fitted out with the surplus funds remaining
from the original subscriptions, which was 'intended
to be placed entirely under the orders of
Dr Livingstone, for the purpose of supplementing
his great discoveries.' The command of this expedition
was conferred upon Lieutenant Cameron,
R.N., who had more than once volunteered to the
Council of the Royal Geographical Society for employment
in Africa, had already spent three years
on the east coast, and had studied the Suahili
language. He left England <i>en route</i> for Zanzibar
on the 30th November 1872, accompanied by
an old messmate in the person of Dr Dillon;
and the public have already been made aware
of the salient points of his journey; of the alteration
in his plans necessitated by the death of
Livingstone; of the death of two of his companions,
and the return of the third from UnyanyembÃ©;
of his solitary advance to Ujiji for the
purpose of recovering some papers of Livingstone's,
left there by him before his last fatal journey;
and of his return in April 1876, after an absence
of three years and four months, after having performed
the hitherto unprecedented feat of traversing
tropical Africa from east to west. Thus the
way has been paved for the appearance of the
two volumes now before us,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which contain a full
account of the whole expedition, of the peculiarities
of the country, and of the manners and customs
of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>If the reader will open an ordinary map of
Africa, he will find to the westward of the great
lakes a blank extending from the equator to
about twelve degrees south, indicative of an almost
entirely unexplored country. This, roughly speaking,
may be called the basin of the river Congo,
which probably drains all or nearly all of that
enormous area. If he will then consult the map
which accompanies these volumes, and will trace
the route of their intrepid author, he will find
that after leaving NyangwÃ© it traverses a most
important and hitherto completely unknown portion
of this district&mdash;namely, the water-shed
separating the two great river systems of the
Congo and Zambesi. In this as well as in his
careful circumnavigation of Lake Tanganyika to
the south of Ujiji, and in the evidence he
brings confirmative of the river Lualaba being
the Congo, the principal geographical value of his
discoveries may be said to rest. Even those who
have not made the physical features of Africa an
especial study cannot fail to follow the author in
the few but lucid remarks he makes on this
subject, especially if they will consult his map,
which not only clearly marks the different water-sheds,
but contains a horizontal section of his
route, shewing at a glance the configuration of
the country. It is not, however, our desire to
enlarge upon the scientific results of his expedition,
though they must not be altogether lost
sight of, but to follow him through the experiences
he recounts in these pages.</p>

<p>Zanzibar was reached without incident, except
the addition of another European to the party in
the person of Lieutenant C. Murphy, R.A., who
volunteered at Aden, and on obtaining permission
from the military authorities, followed them by
next mail. The difficulties of getting together
men and necessaries were enormous&mdash;although
they were fortunate, as they thought at the time,
in securing the services of Bombey, 'the chief of
Speke's faithfuls,' though he did not ultimately
prove of as much service as had been expected&mdash;and
were enhanced by their having arrived simultaneously
with Sir Bartle Frere, to whose mission
they were supposed to be attached, a belief which
occasioned 'numerous vexatious troubles and enormous
expense.' At last, however, they left Zanzibar
on February 2, 1873, in two hired dhows for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">{215}</a></span>
Bagamoyo, 'the principal point of departure for
caravans bound to UnyanyembÃ© and the countries
beyond.' Here pagazi or porters, and askari or
soldiers, had to be hired; but they proved very
slow in engaging themselves; and it was not till
after considerable delay had been experienced that
a start was effected. Before they finally left,
another volunteer joined the expedition&mdash;Robert
Moffat, a grandson of Dr Moffat and a nephew of
Dr Livingstone, who on hearing of it, had sold a
sugar plantation in Natal 'which formed his sole
inheritance,' and had hastened to offer his services.</p>

<p>On his arrival, Cameron determined to push on
at once with Dillon and such men as were already
on the spot, leaving Murphy and Moffat to follow
with the rear division of the caravan. The country
through which they marched consisted of 'rolling
grass-land interspersed with belts of timber, and
every now and then small knolls crowned with
clumps of trees and shrubs;' and as they got
farther from the coast small lagoons made their
appearance, 'in which beautiful large blue-and-white
water-lilies grew.' Before they reached the
Usagara Mountains, which form the first elevation
after leaving the coast, the country became 'well
cultivated, and dotted with numerous hamlets
peeping out of woods and bosquets.' While close
to KisÃ©mo they met with baobab-trees for the first
time; gigantic representatives of the vegetable
kingdom, whose smallest twigs are 'two or three
inches in circumference, and their forms of the
most grotesque ugliness.' Indeed the scenery of
this part of Africa is as highly spoken of by
Lieutenant Cameron as by former travellers; he
says: 'It was so delightful that we scarcely thought
of fatigue.'</p>

<p>After passing the Usagara range, the travellers
came to 'a vast expanse of mud with two or three
troublesome morasses on the western side,' known
as the Makata Swamp, in crossing which an untoward
incident occurred, which resulted in Dr
Dillon having a severe attack of fever and dysentery,
which confined him to his bed for three
weeks. While Cameron was thus detained, bad
news reached him from those in the rear. Both
Murphy and Moffat had suffered from several
attacks of fever, and the latter was very ill. This
was on the 16th May; and on the 26th the party
under their command arrived, but with only one
of the Europeans&mdash;Moffat was dead: the first
victim claimed by the insatiable African climate,
and another name added to the long and noble
list of those who have sacrificed their lives in the
cause of exploration and the suppression of the
slave-trade.</p>

<p>A few days after the receipt of this sad intelligence,
the expedition moved forward, though
Murphy was only partially recovered and the
author was very lame. Their road lay through a
mountainous country, in the dips and valleys
among which the mparamusi tree was observed.
This is one of 'the noblest specimens of arboreal
beauty in the world, having a towering shaft sometimes
fifteen feet in diameter and one hundred and
forty feet high, with bark of a tender yellowish
green, crowned by a spreading head of dark foliage.'
Shortly afterwards they entered the kingdom of
Ugogo, 'a dried-up country with occasional huge
masses of granite, and the stiff Euphorbia clinging
to their sides.' The inhabitants of this district
were reputed to be a brave and warlike race;
but Lieutenant Cameron found them 'the veriest
cowards and poltroons it is possible to conceive.'
They are easily distinguished from other tribes by
the custom of piercing their ears and enlarging
the lobes to an enormous size; 'in fact the ear
of a Mgogo answers much the same purpose as
a pocket to people indulging in wearing apparel.'
At this time, as during the whole journey, much
trouble was experienced from the idleness of the
men, who were also 'constantly grumbling and
growling;' and there is no doubt, as Cameron
afterwards discovered for himself, that they were
treated with too much consideration, and as is
almost invariably the case, took advantage of
their master's kindness.</p>

<p>In the centre of Ugogo is a broad depression
known as KanyenyÃ©, ruled over by a chief named
Magomba, who is mentioned by Burton in 1857,
and is said by the natives to be over three hundred
years of age and to be cutting his fourth
set of teeth. Lieutenant Cameron believes this
ancient chieftain to be in truth 'considerably
over a century,' as his grandchildren were gray
and grizzled; and it is an undoubted fact that
the natives of Africa under favourable conditions
attain to an extremely old age. The price
of provisions in this district was enormous;
'eggs, milk, and butter were more expensive
than in England;' the natural result of the continual
passage of caravans and the few wants of
the natives, who having no use for money, decline
to part with their food except at exorbitant rates,
as soon as their modest requirements in the shape
of cloth and beads are temporarily satisfied.</p>

<p>UnyanyembÃ©, the first stage of the journey, was
at length reached; and the expedition was very
kindly received by the principal Arabs, though
their stay there was destined to be a far from
pleasant one. Within two days of their arrival
the author was attacked by fever, quickly followed
by Dillon and Murphy, which never left them
again for many hours during their stay there.
About this time Dillon wrote home in the following
terms: 'On or about (none of us know the
date correctly) August 13, Cameron felt seedy. I
never felt better; ditto Murphy. In the evening
we felt seedy. I felt determined not to be sick.
"I <i>will</i> eat dinner; I'll <i>not</i> go to bed." Murphy
was between the blankets already. I did manage
some dinner; but shakes enough to bring an
ordinary house down came on, and I had to turn
in. For the next four or five days our diet was
water or milk. Not a soul to look after us. The
servants knew not what to do. We got up when
we liked and walked out. We knew that we felt
giddy; that our legs would scarcely support us.
I used to pay a visit to Cameron, and he used to
come in to me to make complaints. One day he
said: "The fellows have regularly blocked me in&mdash;I
have no room to stir. The worst of it is one
of the legs of the grand piano is always on my
head, and people are strumming away all day. It's
all drawing-room furniture that they have blocked
me in with."' It seems marvellous that expeditions
can be successfully carried through such a
country as this, where all the Europeans composing
them are liable to be simultaneously delirious
from fever, and have to trust to Providence and
their constitutions to get well again, there not
being a soul to look after them. It is indeed
most painful to read the narration of the continual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">{216}</a></span>
sufferings of these brave men; fever, dysentery,
and blindness in continuous succession, and through
it all the work had to be and was carried on. At
last the news of the sad death of Africa's greatest
traveller reached them, and altered all their plans.
The author and Dillon determined to press on
for the west coast <i>viÃ¢</i> Ujiji; while Murphy,
considering the work of the expedition at an end,
decided to return coastwards. Dillon, however,
was unable to carry out his determination, owing
to being attacked a few days later by inflammation
of the bowels, which rendered his return to
the coast the only course which gave any hope
of recovery; and consequently he accompanied
Murphy, while Lieutenant Cameron pursued his
journey alone.</p>

<p>At this time the author says of himself: 'I was
nearly blind from ophthalmia, and almost unable
to walk from the pain in my back; while fever,
which was still hanging about me, had reduced
me to a skeleton, my weight being only seven
stone four.' Yet he determined to persevere. A
few days after his start a messenger arrived with
the dreadful news that Dr Dillon had shot himself
on November 18, while delirious from fever; and
how severely this intelligence was felt by the
survivor may be imagined from his describing the
day on which he received it as the saddest in his
life. The exigences of his own position, however,
at that moment were so great as to demand his
whole attention; porters could hardly be obtained,
and it was only by leaving twelve loads behind,
and reducing his personal kit to a minimum, that
further progress was rendered possible. The country
travelled through 'was perfectly charming, the
trees delicately green and fresh, the open grassy
glades enamelled with various wild-flowers.' Indeed
he says that it would have required no
great stretch of imagination to fancy one's self
'in the wooded part of an English park,' had it
not been for an occasional lion or elephant's skull
which bestrewed the ground. The Sindi was
crossed on February 2, on a mass of floating vegetation,
similar to that which our readers may
remember offered so many obstructions to Sir
Samuel Baker's advance up the Nile; and about
a fortnight later the expedition came in sight of
the great Lake Tanganyika.</p>

<p>The author was hospitably received by the
Arabs at KawÃ©lÃ©, where he remained a few days,
while procuring boats in which to cruise round
the southern coast of the lake. This occupied
about two months; and the reader will find much
interesting information in the portion of the book
devoted to it. By the end of May, the journey
was again resumed, NyangwÃ© being now the
immediate goal, from where Cameron hoped to
reach the mouth of the Congo by descending the
Lualaba in boats. Here the Mpafu tree was
observed for the first time, from the fruit of
which scented oil is obtained. It is a magnificent
tree, often thirty feet or more in circumference,
and rising to eighty or a hundred feet before
spreading and forming a head, the branches of
which are immense. India-rubber vines were also
very common, their stems being the thickness of a
man's thigh. Indeed 'sufficient india-rubber to
supply the wants of the whole world' could easily
be collected there. On this march, as indeed
throughout the whole journey, we hear much
about the slave-trade and its fearful results. The
inhabitants constantly came into camp with slaves
for sale, who were gagged by having 'a piece of
wood like a snaffle tied into their mouths.' Heavy
slave-forks were placed round their necks, and
their hands were fastened behind their backs.
'They were then attached by a cord to the vendor's
waist.'</p>

<p>On arrival at NyangwÃ©, a station of the Zanzibar
traders on the banks of the Lualaba, and
situated at the lowest point in the great depression
which exists across Central Africa, he found
the natives so unwilling to part with their
canoes that he was forced to forego his plan of
descending that river by water; and having
met with a half-caste Arab named Tipo-tipo, who
had a settlement towards the south-west, he decided
to accompany him and attempt to reach Lake
San korra, a large sheet of water into which he
was told the Lualaba ran overland. His hopes in
this direction were, however, also dashed to the
ground by the answer of the chief whose territory it
would be necessary to traverse, that 'no strangers
with guns had ever passed through his country,
and none should without fighting their way.' He
therefore decided to go to the capital of Urua, a
kingdom about a month's journey to the S.S.W.,
where some Portuguese were reported to be, and
if possible work his way from there towards the
mysterious lake.</p>

<p>For some days they journeyed through a 'fairly
populated country, with large villages of well-built
and clean huts, disposed in long streets,
with bark-cloth trees planted on each side;' and a
friendly intercourse was kept up with the natives,
until one day Cameron was 'unpleasantly surprised'
by having some arrows fired at his
party while they were passing through a narrow
strip of jungle. This culminated a day or two
afterwards in a regular attack from a large body
of natives, who were, however, easily beaten
off. In this affair Cameron acted with the very
greatest forbearance; a forbearance which was
probably interpreted by the natives to mean fear,
as they continued to harass him for some days.
The reason given for the attack was that a Portuguese
caravan had been destroying villages in the
neighbourhood, murdering the men, and carrying
off the women and children as slaves. It may be
here noted that Lieutenant Cameron speaks in the
very strongest terms of the conduct of the Portuguese,
and says that 'the cruelties perpetrated in
the heart of Africa by men calling themselves
Christians, and carrying the Portuguese flag, can
scarcely be credited by those living in a civilised
land;' indeed it is not going too far to assert that
the fearful state of anarchy and misery into which
Central Africa is plunged is chiefly if not entirely
owing to the behaviour and example of the Portuguese&mdash;the
late protest to the contrary of the Chamber
of Deputies at Lisbon notwithstanding&mdash;as
well in their settlements on either coast as in
the interior.</p>

<p>The capital of Kasongo, king of Urua, was
reached without further accident; and here we are
introduced to two personages, representing the
extreme type of their respective classes. Jumah
Merikani, an Arab with a dash of the negro,
was a very estimable specimen of his race, being
'the kindest and most hospitable' of the many
Arab traders met with, of whom, as a body,
Cameron speaks in favourable terms; the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">{217}</a></span>
JosÃ© Antonio Alvez, a half-caste Portuguese,
though spoken of by the natives as a white man,
proved himself, by his treatment of the English
traveller, to be a hypocritical liar, thief, and
ruffian, even beyond the ordinary measure of his
class; and it is disheartening, after all that has
been done, to think the name of European must
necessarily become synonymous in the native
mind with that of unmitigated blackguard and
slave-dealer, so long as it is represented by such
as Alvez. Kasongo, the Urua king, himself as
debauched a ruffian as could well be imagined,
willingly assisted Alvez and his crew in their murdering
and plundering expeditions, while he placed
every obstacle in the way of Cameron's explorations,
and detained him to all intents and purposes
a prisoner at his capital. He was, however,
permitted to visit a lake in the neighbourhood,
which contained three detached villages, built on
piles, and only approachable by canoes; but as
Kasongo would give him no help in trying to
reach the Congo, nothing remained but to make
the best of his way to the west coast, as already
his stores and goods had so greatly diminished,
chiefly through theft and robbery on the part of
his own servants, many of whom were the off-scourings
of Zanzibar, that it was doubtful whether
they would prove sufficient even for that distance.</p>

<p>A start was, however, at last happily effected;
and after innumerable delays and difficulties
BihÃ© was reached. On this march Cameron and
his followers suffered much from want of food,
and he even had to sell his shirts and greatcoat
to keep them from actual starvation. From
here to the coast was somewhat over two hundred
and fifty miles; and as the path lay through an
extremely mountainous country, it presented formidable
difficulties to men in such an enfeebled
condition as those who composed the expedition
were from long travel and weeks of semi-starvation.
It was, however, absolutely necessary to press forward,
and the march through Bailunda was at once
commenced. The scenery of this district is spoken
of by Lieutenant Cameron in the most glowing
terms; 'neither poet with all the wealth of word-imagery,
nor painter with almost supernatural
genius, could by pen or pencil do full justice to
the country of Bailunda;' 'nothing could be more
lovely than this entrancing scene, this glimpse of
paradise.' Little time was, however, allowed him
to enjoy its beauties, as the necessity of hurrying
forward before the men utterly broke down was
too pressing to be trifled with.</p>

<p>Indeed soon after, twenty men complained of
being unable to continue the journey; 'swelled legs,
stiff necks, aching backs, and empty stomachs being
the universal cry.' It therefore became necessary
to adopt some decisive step; and Cameron decided
to throw away everything but instruments, journals,
and books; and taking a few picked companions,
make a forced march to the coast. It is already
well known that this measure proved successful;
that Benguela was reached, though not a day too
soon, as even twenty-four hours' delay would have
probably caused the scurvy which had attacked
him to end fatally; and that those left behind
were succoured, and ultimately restored to Zanzibar,
while Lieutenant Cameron returned to England.</p>

<p>Thus concludes the graphic and well told narrative
contained in these two volumes, which,
despite some trifling literary shortcomings, are
thoroughly deserving of recommendation to the
reading public. Their story is simply told, but
the interest is well maintained throughout, especially
on those points which touch on the horrors
of the slave-trade and the evil results of Portuguese
rule. In conclusion, we may add that since
Dr Schweinfurth published <i>The Heart of Africa</i>,
no book on African travel has appeared with illustrations
in any way comparable with those which
embellish these volumes.</p>

<p class='p3'>IN TWO PARTS.</p>

<p class='p2'>PART I.&mdash;SUNSHINE.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER I.&mdash;ISAAC WEBB.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Isaac Webb</span> was twenty-four years of age. He
was very tall, very thin, and very pale; on the
whole, his appearance was not prepossessing. To
these outward gifts might be added two inward
ruling passions&mdash;love of self and love of money.
It may be taken that the one was as powerful as
the other. Some people said that he loved Isaac
Webb more than the root of all evil; others, that
he loved the said root more than the said Isaac
Webb: the point was never decided, so they may
be bracketed equal. But he had some good points,
as every one has. In the first place, he was by no
means of a suspicious or jealous turn of mind.
This may have proceeded from the great confidence
he had in his own judgment; for he
thought himself a very shrewd fellow, a very
deep dog. 'You're not to be easily bowled over,
Isaac,' he would say to himself very often, rubbing
his hands; 'and if anybody thinks he can snuff
you out, let him try it on, and burn his fingers&mdash;ha,
ha!' Such were Isaac's modest reflections
on his own sagacity.</p>

<p>Another point to be scored to him was his
abstemiousness. But certain uncharitable people
ascribed even this to a second motive. 'For,'
said they, 'he don't eat much because of the
economy of the thing; and he does not drink
anything except water, not because he's pledged to
it, or because stronger drink don't agree with him,
for why does he make up for it when he can do it
at somebody else's expense?' This is what they
said, and it certainly was rude of them to make
such remarks; but it must be admitted that Isaac
did not despise the creature comforts of this life
when he did not have to stand treat to himself.
Now it is impossible to account for this fact; he
could not himself&mdash;never even attempted it. He
had many other little peculiarities and traits of
character, but they only revolved as minor worlds
around the great suns above specified.</p>

<p>Isaac Webb was an orphan; that is to say his
father had died when our hero was yet in his
infancy; and his mother feeling her first husband's
loss to be so deplorable, had joined herself unto
another, and had emigrated with that gentleman to
Australia when Isaac was about thirteen years old,
leaving that worthy youth to the care of her half-brother,
who in <i>his</i> turn had departed this mortal
life about a year previous to the opening of this
story, leaving its hero entirely to his own devices.
He had a few other relatives scattered about the
country, but none on whom he bestowed more than
a passing remembrance. In the first place it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">{218}</a></span>
cheaper, for he had nothing to expect from them;
and in the second, he did not want them, nor did
they want him.</p>

<p>His visible means of subsistence were derived
from the rents accruing from a whole nest of
cottages situated in the country town near which
he resided, together with a few good-sized parcels
of garden-ground and sundry other 'effects,' including
about a thousand pounds in ready-money
put out at interest, but on which he could lay his
hand whenever he thought proper. Altogether
his net income (after deducting a decent amount
for repairs, tenants who travelled by night unexpectedly,
and other casualties) amounted to about
two hundred and fifty pounds a year; and on this
sum he had boarded, lodged, and clothed himself
since he came of age, and had contrived out of it
to put by a very pretty slice as well.</p>

<p>His place of habitation consisted of two small
rooms over a little grocer's shop at Dambourne
End in Southshire, about a mile distant from the
town of Dambourne, in which place his patrimony
was situated. He was engaged in no business,
though fully appreciative of the L. S. D. side of
the question, but considered that his interests and
fortunes were bound up in the cottages and garden-ground,
and that he should be leaving the substance
and grasping a shadow if he in any way
neglected the inheritance and devoted his time
to any other pursuit&mdash;at all events at present.
Thus he had lived from day to day for the last
few years without any kind of change to vary
the monotony of his existence. He had but few
friends, and those of a very commercial character,
and no luxuries or amusements beyond a second
day's paper, and an occasional&mdash;very occasional&mdash;new
suit of clothes. Therefore it was not so very
extravagant of him to take into consideration, in
the early summer of the year 1868, whether it
would not be well to treat himself to a little change
of air and scene. He had not, he fancied, been
feeling quite the thing lately; and he thought it
might be a wise proceeding on his part to recruit
his health and spirits, and at the same time add
to his already large store (in his own eyes) of
shrewdness and worldly knowledge. Of course he
never for a moment contemplated anything so
costly and unnecessary to him as a mere pleasure-trip,
so did not need to consider the most comfortable
and enjoyable place whereat to spend the
next five or six weeks of the summer. Not at all.
He had only to make up his own mind as to the
place where it would be possible to find anything
fresh to add to his crowded storehouse of facts,
monetary and otherwise.</p>

<p>As he that June evening thus ruminated in his
little parlour over the shop, a bright idea suddenly
occurred to him. 'Isaac,' said he, 'where have
your wits been wool-gathering all this time?
Oughtn't you to have known in a twinkle that
there was only one place that would do for you?
London's the only place that's fit for <i>your</i> capabilities,
my boy; and London it shall be.'</p>


<h3>CHAPTER II.&mdash;OUR HERO PREPARES TO GO TO
LONDON.</h3>

<p>There were, however, one or two little matters
to be arranged, before Isaac could give himself up
to his journey in search of fresh experience. One
was to endeavour to find a tenant for his lodgings
during the time that he would be absent from
them, because it would never do for him to pay
for the use of two beds and sleep only in one.
But in this he met with no difficulty; for on his
popping the question (not matrimonially of course)
to Mrs Clappen, his landlady, she immediately
averred that the circumstance was providential.
Isaac himself did not quite see how Providence
was likely to be interested in so mundane a matter
as lodgings to let, so ventured to ask why.</p>

<p>Mrs Clappen explained. 'Well, sir,' said she,
'a young gent which is quite a stranger to me,
looked in the shop, you see, yesterday mornin'&mdash;yes,
it must ha' been in the mornin' time, for Mrs
Swaller had jest come in for to get some Epsin
salts for her little boy, which is things I don't 'old
no belief in myself, though sellin' 'em for the
benefit, as you may say, of them as does; and I
was jest a-asking Mrs Swaller if she wouldn't
have a packet or two of grits to make a little
gruel in order to comfort her little boy's stumick,
as you may say, and she was jest a-sayin' as her
youngest child's teeth, which is a twelvemonth
old come next Sunday week at a little afore two,
wasn't doing as she could wish, when this gent,
which is a stranger to me, as you may say, looked
in the door, and says: "Ladies," he says&mdash;them
was his words&mdash;"Ladies, I am hextremely sorry
to disturb you, more particular in your maternal
simperthisin's," he says; "but does either of you
ladies 'appen to know whether anybody 'appens to
'ave a good-sized room, or two small uns adjoining,
which would be equally convenient, ladies," he
says, "to let at a lowish figure for about a month
or so in a week or two, ladies."</p>

<p>'We was naturally taken with 'is <i>h</i>air and that;
and I says to Mrs Swaller: "Do you know of
any think that would do for this 'ere gent?" I says.
"Well, no, I don't, not 'ereabouts," she says; "but
I 'eard Mrs Speller, what lives up agen the 'pike,
say as 'ow she wouldn't mind meetin' with a
genteel party, which of course we 'ave 'ere," she
says, alludin' to 'is <i>h</i>air; "but that's a couple of
mile furder on," she says, "and might be too far
for the gentleman. And besides," she says, "she
couldn't board him, and that might be naturally
ill-convenient." And the gent, he says, with a
pleasant smile, quite afferble: "Ladies, I mustn't
be no furder away from Dambourne town than
this," he says; "and if you don't know of nothink
else, ladies," he says, with a hamiable smile, "'ere's
my address," he says, "in case you 'appen to 'ear
of anythink.&mdash;Good mornin', ladies," he says; and
with that he went off, as you may say.' Mrs
Clappen, quite out of breath, wiped her face with
her apron as she concluded her narrative.</p>

<p>After a few questions from Isaac as to what the
person was like, and if Mrs Clappen thought he
would take care of the place, and not wear the
carpet out, and so on, it was settled that she
should write to Mr Scamplin, for such was his
name, offering him her apartments for six weeks
certain, at the same price her present lodger was
paying; and stating that they would be at his disposal
at that day week, if he liked to take them,
and on his giving two references; Mrs Clappen
declaring that she ''ad no doubt from 'is <i>h</i>air' that
all would be satisfactory, and that Mr Scamplin
would come to terms.</p>

<p>The following morning, found Isaac with his
tailor&mdash;Mr Batfid by name&mdash;who carried on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">{219}</a></span>
small business at Dambourne, and who exhibited
in his window a placard (pinned on to an antique
pair of hunting breeches) announcing in faded red-and-blue
characters the fact of all orders and
repairs being executed with fidelity and despatch;
which gave one the idea that any unfortunate
coat or other garment that might come under
Mr Batfid's manipulation was forthwith mutilated
and murdered, a black flag being hoisted to celebrate
the event. But Isaac formed no such suspicious
notions, but took himself to the industrious
proprietor, and ten o'clock found him in the
agonies of measurement with Mr Batfid&mdash;a very
small man&mdash;on a chair behind him, stretching up
to his collar. These preliminaries ended, and the
material (of a good wearing colour) chosen, the
small but highly respectable man of business was
all but thrown off his balance by Isaac's announcement
that he must have the complete suit home in
four days from that time. Mr Batfid declared that
he did not see how he could possibly accomplish
so much in so short a time. 'For,' said he, to give
weight to his argument, 'you must remember that
you are a very tall gentleman, a very fine figure,
sir, and all the seams are naturally very long.'</p>

<p>'It did not occur to me before,' said Isaac; 'but
I ought to have gone to the ready-made place
lately opened at the corner, for I am told their
charges are very low, and there is of course no
delay in getting your things home.'</p>

<p>Mr Batfid hoped if he had any respect for his
fine proportions that Mr Webb would never come
down to that; and finally promised, in order to
oblige a customer, that the garments should be
finished by the time named, even if he only took
a few passing winks of sleep on his board until
they were completed.</p>

<p>Isaac having thus arranged matters with the
worthy tailor, bethought himself that he had
neither invested in new boots nor a new hat for
a long time past, but had been wearing out sundry
old ones, formerly in the occupation of his mother's
half-brother, lately deceased; so betook himself
to the necessary shops for providing himself with
these luxuries; and having walked past the cottages
and garden-ground, took himself and his new purchases
home to his lodgings.</p>

<p>Two days later the post brought a letter from
Mr Scamplin, engaging Mrs Clappen's rooms, and
inclosing two London references (whence also he
hailed), which were about as useful to that estimable
lady as if he had mentioned a friend in
Greenland and referred her to <i>him</i>; but she had
such trust 'in 'is <i>h</i>air,' that she was sure it was
all right; and Isaac, not being of a suspicious turn
of mind, fell in with her views on the subject. So
Mr Scamplin was written to, and the matter was
settled.</p>

<p>Isaac having given the cottages and garden-ground
into the charge of an old school-fellow of
his, who was proprietor of a stationer's business
(on a very limited scale as to stationery) and a
night-school (very limited also as to learning,
charges, and scholars), patiently waited for Mr
Batfid's promise to be fulfilled, and was ready for
his flight.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER III.&mdash;IN THE METROPOLIS.</h3>

<p>Mr Batfid was true to his word, and the new
clothes were duly delivered; and when day broke
on the 13th of June, all was in readiness for Isaac's
departure. Mrs Clappen, after much cogitation,
could put this journey down to no other cause
than her lodger's marriage on the quiet; not that
she had reason to suppose he meditated taking
such a step, but as he was so 'close' in his manner,
she was pretty sure he would not take her into
his confidence until the fact was accomplished.
Although this was not Isaac's intention just at
present, yet he had often thought whether he, as
a landed proprietor, ought not to take unto himself
a wife. With so very much on his side, he
had no doubt of being able to find, whenever he
might think proper to seek, a lady not only ready
but eager to ally herself to so desirable a partner.</p>

<p>The only bar to his taking upon himself the
holy estate of matrimony had been the expense;
since he justly considered that no two persons, be
they ever so economical, could by any possibility
subsist on the same amount of rations, &amp;c. as one,
even supposing them to be like the wedded couple
celebrated in song, one of whom could eat no fat,
the other no lean, and thus, by a happy division
of labour, accomplishing the cleanliness of the
platter. It was not likely that Isaac would be so
fortunate as this; and supposing he were, he and
his good lady would not be able to do a similar
thing with regard to clothes as the before-mentioned
happy pair did with regard to victuals.</p>

<p>Isaac had many times considered this matter,
and with his usual perspicuity, had arrived at the
conclusion that there was but one course open to
him; to wit, his alliance with some lady possessing
sufficient means of her own to be able to bear her
share in the cost of housekeeping&mdash;thus making
matrimony subservient to patrimony; and his
intention was to look out for such a party.</p>

<p>The sunlight peeping into Isaac's bedroom
awoke that wary individual, who proceeded to arise
and dress himself in his new apparel. This apparel
was not, after all, entirely satisfactory, inasmuch
as Mr Batfid, too much impressed apparently with
the magnitude of his undertaking, had exaggerated
the length of the seams and the fineness of his
customer's figure; for Isaac found himself arrayed
in a pair of inexpressibles very much too long, a
waistcoat very much too tight, and a coat very
much too high in the neck, very much too long
in the sleeves, and likewise in the waist.</p>

<p>Nothing could be done but brace up the first
until they nearly mounted to his arm-pits (and
were even then too long), let out the second as far
as it would go, and turn up the cuffs of the third.
Thus habited, and with a cotton umbrella in one
hand and an old carpet-bag in the other, Isaac
made for the railway station, caught the 10.33
train, and was whisked up to London in an hour
and five minutes.</p>

<p>He was not an entire stranger in that city, for he
had visited it once before in company with his
mother's half-brother, and remembered where to
put up; namely, at a small coffee-house in the
neighbourhood of Islington. Arrived there and a
small bedroom engaged, the umbrella and bag
were deposited in a corner, and Isaac, after carefully
locking the door, took himself out for a
stroll, telling the landlord he would be back at
six o'clock, when he would regale himself with a
chop and slice of cheese by way of dinner. Not
that he entertained any high-fangled notions about
dining late, but because of the economy of the
thing; for a bun and a glass of water contented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">{220}</a></span>
him in the middle of the day; and by this arrangement
of six o'clock dinner, tea and supper were
both dispensed with, these two meals per day
being thus ticked off to Isaac's credit.</p>

<p>The first few weeks of his sojourn passed in a
manner that would have been intolerably slow to
anybody else, but did not appear so to him. There
was much for him to see and admire in his own
way, and this way was to walk about from morn
till eve through the crowded streets, and more
particularly those which were devoted entirely to
business. Thus, next to a visit to the Docks, perhaps
his favourite walk was through Upper and
Lower Thames Street, where he would watch the
loading and unloading of the various goods and
merchandise. Not indeed with any distinct and
particular purpose; but it was a delight to him to
gaze upon these outward signs of the wealth within,
and to ruminate on the possibility that he might
one day acquire a share and interest in some large
money-making business, which would serve as a
stepping-stone to yet greater wealth and influence;
and to be able to purchase such an interest was
probably one of the reasons for his parsimoniousness.
A laudable ambition, so far as it went; but
the end was more thought of than the means by
which it was to be accomplished; not indeed that
he harboured an intention of any dishonesty, but
he simply considered that the more he scraped, the
sooner the final consummation would be attained.</p></div>

<h2><a name="POISONED_ARROWS" id="POISONED_ARROWS">POISONED ARROWS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">That</span> savages in various quarters of the world
possess the knowledge and means of rendering
their arrows poisonous, is a statement which is
generally believed by ordinary individuals, from
the schoolboy fresh from the perusal of books of
adventure and travel, to his more mature and
less sanguine elders. When, however, this topic
is subjected to strict and sober investigation, it is
found to present elements of inconsistency, or at
anyrate of doubt, which at once tend to modify
the previous and apparently well-founded belief
of the inquirer. It is, in fact, found that the
knowledge and use of deadly poisons by savages
have been simply taken for granted, and that most
of the stories or tales of the marvellous effects of
wounds inflicted by poisoned weapons are based
upon no kind of reliable evidence. These remarks
apply to the general accounts given of the practice
of savages in this respect. It is well known, however,
that in some special instances an accurate
practical knowledge of vegetable poisons is possessed
by certain savage races. Thus the famous
Woorali poison, obtained from a plant allied to
that which affords the <i>Strychnia</i> of medicine, is
used as a poison by South American tribes; and
the juice of an allied plant (<i>Strychnos cogens</i>) is
used to poison arrows in Darien and Panama.</p>

<p>But putting cases of poisoning by matter derived
from vegetables entirely out of the question, it is
also a matter of belief that savages have become
possessed of the knowledge that animal matters in
a state of putrefaction or decay, when introduced
into the circulation, are capable of causing serious
consequences, or even death itself. Accordingly
certain races were believed to poison their spears
and arrows by dipping them in the putrefying
carcase of some animal; the results of wounding
by these weapons being supposed to resemble those
seen familiarly amongst ourselves, in the case of
medical men and others who have accidentally
punctured themselves whilst performing <i>post-mortem</i>
examinations or dissections. Here again,
however, elements of discrepancy appear. For
the pathologist demands generally the existence
of some special poison, generated by some special
process in the course of putrefaction. In other
words, cases of true blood-poisoning by decomposing
animal matter are not of invariable occurrence
after dissection-wounds; and such cases are further
subject to modifying conditions in the patient&mdash;such
as those of age, state of health, and susceptibility
to the action of the poison.</p>

<p>Some highly interesting and important information
on the present subject has recently been
afforded by the inquiries of Staff-surgeon Messer
of the royal navy, into the reputed poisonous
qualities and nature of the arrows of South Sea
islanders&mdash;a race which, more perhaps than any
other tribe of savages, has been credited with the
knowledge and use of poisoned weapons. Dr
Messer had an excellent opportunity of making
investigations into this subject during the visits of
H.M.S. <i>Pearl</i> to the New Hebrides islands, and to
the islands of Banks and Santa Cruz, in the
summer of 1875; and as certain cases of wounding
with arrows occurred under Dr Messer's eyes and
were treated by him, his remarks on this subject
possess a more than usual interest.</p>

<p>The common belief that savages possess the
requisite knowledge and skill to manipulate and
concentrate vegetable poisons, so that these poisons
may prove of effective kind when applied to
weapons, and used, it may be long after the application
of the fresh poison, is freely commented
upon in an adverse manner by Dr Messer. He
further points out that savages themselves may
firmly believe in the deadly nature of their
weapons, without having any idea of the really
innocuous nature of the substances with which
they have smeared them. And great allowance
must also be made for the influence of fear and
superstition. The implicit belief in the poisonous
nature of the weapons forms a point of no mean
importance in the consideration of the causes
whereby serious or fatal effects are produced.
The 'nervous system becomes liable,' to use Dr
Messer's words, 'to certain diseases on the slightest
provocation;' and once convinced of the deadly
nature of the weapon which has wounded him, the
savage&mdash;and the civilised man also&mdash;comes to
regard a fatal result as inevitable&mdash;this result
accruing simply from 'want of moral courage to
resist disease.'</p>

<p>The chief element in cases of poisoning which
appears to have given countenance to the reality
of the effects of the poison, is the occurrence of
tetanus or lock-jaw after wounds. This disease,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">{221}</a></span>
familiar to every medical man, as also resulting
from injuries entirely dissociated from poisoned
wounds, is ascribed by the uninitiated and ignorant
to the effects of the poisoned weapons of
the savage. And hence the belief in the potency
of the virus becomes more and more assured.
Thus, as is well known, Commodore Goodenough
and a party of men were fired at with arrows at
Carlisle Bay in Santa Cruz. The officer and five
men were wounded by arrows, and a second officer
had his hand scratched with the point of an arrow
held in the hand of a native. The wounds in
every case were slight. But the ship was ordered
to return to the more temperate climate of Sydney,
in order to give the sufferers the best chance of
averting, what Dr Messer feared might possibly
be favoured by the heat of the climate&mdash;namely,
the occurrence of tetanus. All went well until
the fifth and sixth days after the reception of the
wounds, when the Commodore and two of his men
began to shew symptoms of this disorder, which
unfortunately proved fatal to the three patients
within sixty hours.</p>

<p>Now, as Dr Messer proceeds to remark, here
were three cases which might be cited, and which
have been referred to as proving the actual occurrence
of poisoning after the wounds of arrows.
But the query which science asks is, whether the
symptoms in these cases present any difference
from those in ordinary cases of tetanus, and
whether anything special occurred in their history
to indicate the action of a specific poison? Without
entering into particulars, it may be asserted
that these cases, in every detail, presented nothing
unusual or inconsistent with the idea of their
being instances of ordinary tetanus. The occurrence
of the disease was favoured&mdash;as is well
known to medical men&mdash;in the wounded by the
mental excitement and fear consequent on the
belief that the arrows had been poisoned. There
was, in fact, an utter absence of all the symptoms
of poisoning; and the tetanus did not occur under
any unwonted conditions, but simply under those
which favour its development after injuries of
ordinary kind. Where then, it may be asked, is
the evidence of poisoning? To this query the
obvious reply must be that, as regards the reputed
poison of the arrows, no evidence is forthcoming,
from the entire history of the case.</p>

<p>The actual investigation of the arrows of the
natives of the South Pacific islands forms by no
means the least interesting part of Dr Messer's
communication. The arrows are generally composed
of three pieces&mdash;the shaft made of a light
cane, the head composed of hard wood, and the
point or barb formed simply of the sharpened end
of the head, of a sharp bit of bone, of the fin-spine
of a fish, or the spine of a sea-urchin's shell. Specimens
obtained from the New Hebrides measured
three feet in length, and weighed about eighty
grains; the points being formed of a piece of
human bone of very tapering form, and ground
down to a very fine point. The point was smeared
with a black substance which had dried in separate
masses upon the bone. The arrows which were
fired upon Commodore Goodenough and his party
at Carlisle Bay, Santa Cruz, were four feet in
length, and had points, composed of slender and
sharp pieces of human bone, about eight inches
in length. The 'poisoned' arrows are carried about
in quivers, and are not only carefully looked after
by the natives, but are very difficult to obtain,
presumably on account of the natives being jealous
that the purchasers might become possessed of
the knowledge of the poison, which in their eyes
renders the weapons so valuable. The arrows of
the Santa Cruz islanders were not carried as
poisoned arrows almost invariably are, and were
readily sold to the crew of the <i>Pearl</i> by the natives.</p>

<p>As far as could be ascertained, the processes
adopted by the South Sea islanders to poison their
arrows, consist firstly in the habit of inserting the
weapons in various parts of a decomposing human
body; the neighbourhood of the kidneys being
usually preferred for this purpose. Now, as
already remarked, it so happens that physiologists
and medical men are in possession of some
very definite information regarding the manner
in which decomposing animal matters act on the
human organism. And on the other hand, there
appears to be an utter lack of evidence obtained
from the observation of cases of poisoned-arrow
wounds, to shew that there is any analogy between
the symptoms observed in these cases and those
prevailing after blood-poisoning. It is also very
worthy of remark that tetanus&mdash;the commonest
result of poisoned-arrow wounds&mdash;is not known
to be caused by the introduction, within the
system, of decomposing animal matter.</p>

<p>The second mode in which the natives of the
South Pacific islands are believed to render their
arrows noxious, is that of smearing them with
some poisonous vegetable matters. It is probable
that if poisoned arrows are really prepared by
savages in any way, it is in this latter mode that
they are rendered noxious. But there is an evident
discrepancy between the action of any known
vegetable poisons and the symptoms observed
after wounding with the arrows of savages. Thus
woorali acts by paralysing the muscles concerned
in breathing. 'Corroval' and 'bao,' two poisons
allied to woorali, act by causing coma or stupor
and paralysis of the heart. The effect of the
Upas tree of Java (<i>Strychnos tiente</i>) is to produce
artificial tetanus; and strychnia introduced into
the blood directly, as by inoculation, gives rise to
marked symptoms, which resemble tetanus&mdash;but
with this remarkable and notable distinction, that
the tetanic convulsions set in <i>immediately</i> after
the poison has been introduced into the system,
and not after several days of incubation. Thus
it is clear, from this latter fact alone, that strychnia
and its allies can hardly represent the poisons with
which the arrows of savages are smeared&mdash;admitting
that these weapons are poisonous in any
degree.</p>

<p>The historical accounts of cases of wounding
by the arrows of savages, evince a singular want
of any distinct or decided evidence to prove the
clearly specific nature of any symptoms observed.
Thus MendaÃ±a in 1595 remarks that the Santa Cruz
islanders were believed to use poisoned arrows,
but the Spaniards did not believe the poison to be
of very noxious kind. Burney in the <i>History of
Discoveries in the South Seas</i> makes an observation
to the same effect; and as Dr Messer well remarks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">{222}</a></span>
probably no fatal case occurred&mdash;with one exception&mdash;from
wounding with the arrows, else such a
result would have surely been mentioned. In
1797 Carteret in the <i>Swallow</i> visited Santa Cruz,
and several of his crew were severely wounded by
arrows of the usually reputed and poisonous kind.
Three fatal cases occurred, but no mention is
made of the effects being due to poison&mdash;a fact
which would have been expected to have been
duly chronicled from its interesting, if also sad,
nature. Direct experiments with poisoned arrows
are mentioned in the second volume of Forster's
account of Cook's <i>Voyages</i>; the arrows being those
of the New Hebrides islanders. A dog was
wounded with the weapons, but no ill effects
followed; whilst fishes were not affected after
being wounded with these avowedly poisonous
weapons. A pig wounded in 1827 by a poisoned
arrow from the Santa Cruz islands, exhibited no
symptoms whatever; and it is noteworthy to find
that in the attack on Bishop Patteson's party at
Santa Cruz in 1864, after which two deaths from
tetanus occurred from wounding by arrows, the
weapons were said <i>not</i> to have been poisoned.
Here we find an effect produced from non-poisoned
arrows similar to that observed in the case of
Commodore Goodenough after wounding with
weapons reputed to be poisoned.</p>

<p>Accounts given by missionaries of the probable
nature of the poisons used to render arrows
noxious, appear to shew that the natives of the
North New Hebrides and Banks' islands do not
themselves attach importance to the effects of the
substance with which the arrows are poisoned, but
seem to regard the innocuous human bone, forming
the point of the weapon, as a powerful agent in producing
deleterious effects. The poisons, according
to the evidence of the missionaries, are derived
from vegetables; the plants used in Banks' islands
being 'Toe,' a species of EuphorbiaceÃ¦, and 'Loke,'
a climbing plant, allied to Strychnia. The same
evidence declares the fact that the usual effects
of wounding with arrows so prepared are inflammation,
and occasionally tetanus; but the important
remark is also made that the natives of the
South Pacific are very subject to tetanus 'after
wounds <i>not</i> produced by poisoned arrows,' and
that this disorder is also common among the
natives independently of wounding.</p>

<p>Professor Halford of Melbourne University&mdash;an
authority on snake-bites&mdash;gives evidence to the
effect that dogs and pigeons exhibited no evil
effects after being wounded in various ways by
poisoned arrows, obtained from the Solomon
Islands, and by the substances obtained from
these weapons.</p>

<p>That Dr Messer's observations on this subject
therefore afford good grounds for believing that
many of the reports relating to the deadly nature
of the arrows used by the South Sea islanders are
decidedly erroneous, there can be no reasonable
doubt. And that many of the cases of so-called
poisoning are due simply to mental fear and the
physical irritation inducing tetanus, seems also a
fair inference. But there can be no doubt, that
at the same time, travellers and missionaries, by
careful observation, might furnish scientific men
with secure data upon which to establish sound
conclusions. At present, the entire body of evidence
clearly warrants us in entertaining a negative
opinion regarding firstly the generally poisonous
nature of the arrows of South Sea islanders;
and secondly regarding the use by these races of
any active poison derived from decomposing
animal matter.</p></div>

<h2><a name="MINDING_THE_BAIRN" id="MINDING_THE_BAIRN">MINDING THE BAIRN.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> little story of 'Rob Graham,' which lately
appeared in these pages, may possibly have aroused
some interest concerning the poor but by no means
insufficient manner in which children are reared
among the Scottish peasantry. They get their
food regularly, though in a plain way. They are
usually stuffed into holes and corners to sleep.
The older girls take charge of the younger; even
the boys are pressed into this sort of service. All
without exception run about barefooted in summer&mdash;not
altogether on account of the cost of shoes,
but from preference. Where there are burns to
paddle in, and waters to cross, shoes and stockings
would only be an encumbrance.</p>

<p>A farm establishment in Scotland is familiarly
known by the Anglo-Saxon term, the <i>toun</i>. It is
so called by the workers on the farm. Embraced
in the toun, though situated perhaps at a hundred
yards distant, is a row of cottages with little
gardens behind them. These are the quarters of
the hinds or ploughmen and their families. Ordinarily,
there are dwellings for five or six hinds,
besides one for the grieve or overseer. Latterly,
the condition of the hinds&mdash;at least in the southern
counties&mdash;has been greatly improved. They are
each allowed so much oatmeal per annum; and
perhaps a cow, which is allowed to graze with the
cows of the farmer. There is an allowance of a
rig or two of potatoes. A pig may be kept. The
farmer engages to give the use of a horse and cart
to drive a certain quantity of coals. Besides these
indispensable allowances, there is a wage paid in
money. The total value may be estimated at from
fifty to sixty pounds a year. That does not seem a
large income, but the outgoings are small&mdash;very
different from what they are among artisans in
large towns, where everything has to be bought
and paid for. There is the house free of rent; the
oatmeal for the porridge; milk from the cow in
abundance; potatoes for the lifting and storing;
coal driven to the very door; vegetables from the
garden; fresh and pure water from the mountain
rill; hams of the last year's pig dangling from the
ceiling. For all this there is doubtless pretty hard
labour in the field and barn; yet there are many
assuagements. The labour is regular and healthful.
Nothing is paid for seats in the parish
church; the minister exacts no fees for baptisms;
the children are educated for a trifle in the nearest
school; even before the late access of educational
power, there was no want of schooling, nor was
there any disinclination to make use of it. We do
not remember ever visiting the house of a Scottish
peasant and not seeing books&mdash;very frequently a
large family Bible&mdash;and that is saying a good deal.</p>

<p>For anything like thrift and comfort, there is of
course a dependence on the wife. She has no
servants to assist her. She could not pay for help.
She is wife, house-servant, and cook all in one.
Woe be to the hind who marries a slattern, one
who likes finery and has a taste for delicacies!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">{223}</a></span>
This, however, rarely occurs. We can say that
within our observation the hinds' wives are thrifty
and industrious, making the best of matters within
their sphere. To use a common phrase, they soon
'fall into a family.' Then arise new duties to
be encountered. We have often been filled with
wonder how they at all manage to conduct their
multifarious affairs. Not only the house to look
after, but a crowd of children. It is a blessed
thing for them that there is the open air, with
the slip of green before the door, to which all the
youngsters at times may be bundled, and where
they rollick and tumble about, strengthening their
legs and arms, and bringing their lungs into
splendid exercise. Without a particle of scientific
knowledge, the <i>clachan</i> generally is by intuition
kept in excellent health.</p>

<p>The hind's wife, in looking forward to a family,
is hopeful that her first-born may be a female.
The hope is quite natural. In high life, where it
is important to have a male heir to an estate, it is
anxiously hoped that the first will be a boy; and
when he makes his appearance, the bonfires are
set ablazing. Among the cottagers we are talking
about, there is no heritage but toil. The poor
wife, foreseeing what may be her fate&mdash;a 'heavy
handful' of children&mdash;piously wishes that she may
be provided with a girl, who will grow up to help
her in her interminable round of duties. Heaven
has heard and answered her prayer. A baby girl
is placed in the loving arms of her mother. We
need not be surprised that the infancy of this
eldest daughter, as conventionally considered, is
curtailed in order that she may qualify for the
position of nurse to her brothers and sisters. As
early as her sixth year, she has not only to
superintend the amusements of those next to
her in seniority, but to undertake the sole
charge of the baby while the parent is otherwise
necessarily employed. And it is marvellous
how aptly a child so placed will assume
the air of responsibility, and evince the tact and
solicitude of maternity! When children better
circumstanced are yet devoted to the interests
of their dolls, she is seated at the cottage-door,
or on the green bank amongst the daisies, singing
to her little human charge, or with matronly
pride twining chaplets of the simple flowers for
its adornment. Her engrossment would be perfect,
but that she has occasionally to cast her eye
in the direction of the burn to see that Johnnie,
aged four, has not ventured too close to its margin;
or to look that Bessie, in the innocence of her two
and a half years, does not pull the tail of the
faithful but cross-grained old collie which snoozes
on the grass beside them. Returned home with
her charges as gloaming falls, the baby is transferred
to its mother; but the little maid's anxieties are
not yet ended. She assists Johnnie and Bessie to
their suppers, and then, amid pleasant reminiscences
of the day's simple events, undresses them
for bed. In virtue of her position in the household,
she herself is permitted to sit up an hour or
two later, and is rewarded for her good behaviour
by being permitted for a short time to nurse baby
in its night-clothes. Thus the first-born girl
grows up to womanhood&mdash;her mother's right hand
and the friend-in-council to each and all of her
nurslings.</p>

<p>Where the elder children are boys, the less
fortunate mother has to do her best with the
material at her disposal&mdash;that is, invest one or
other of her manikins with the rÃ´le of nurse.
The character is not so natural, nor can the experiment,
we are afraid, be considered an invariable
success; and yet we have known boys with
strong innate love for children, whose skill and
devotedness in nursing would put to shame many
a woman of average maternal instinct. But however
that may be, the young rustic rarely escapes
altogether what to many of them is at times the
irksome task of 'minding the bairn,' although, on
the score of his incipient manhood, he may the
earlier transfer the service to his juniors. At one
stage or other of his boyhood, if his supply of sisters
is limited, he is liable to be called from his hoop
or marbles, or to forego his projected bird-nesting,
in order to rock the cradle or dandle the baby
while mother washes up the house or gets ready
father's dinner. Even the youngest of the family
does not always succeed in evading the doom of his
elders; for one or other of these having married
young and settled down in the neighbourhood, has
of course defied all that philosophy has said or
might have to say on the subject, and straightway
added to the population; so that nothing is more
natural than that the immature uncle or aunt
should be wheedled or coerced into tending their
still tenderer relatives until one of them shall have
developed sufficiently to assume the hereditary
duties of its position.</p>

<p>A curious reversion of this case is when the
grandchildren are called upon to 'mind' their
uncles or aunts&mdash;a by no means inconceivable
circumstance, when the frequency of early marriages
among the poor is considered. We remember
some years ago, while on a visit in Forfarshire,
that this very subject was broached by our
hostess, who, as faithful helpmate of the minister,
was herself mother-in-chief to the parish. She
told us of a poor woman who had had a great
number of children, all of whom had died young
except one, a girl, who had married early, but who
also died, in giving birth to an infant son. The
infant was taken care of by the bereaved grandmother,
who was still in the prime of life, and who
had herself, after the adoption of her grandson,
other two children, one of which survived, a fine boy
of fifteen months old. At our friend's invitation
we visited with her the humble cottage where this
singular combination of relationships existed. The
mistress was busy churning as we entered, while
seated by the fire was the grandson, some eight or
nine years of age, engrossed in the task of amusing
the baby. After greeting the good dame in homely
kindly manner, the minister's wife turned to the
children and asked: 'How are you to-day, Jockie?'</p>

<p>'Fine,' answered the little fellow bashfully.</p>

<p>'And how is your uncle?' continued his questioner
with a merry twinkle in her eye and a
significant glance at us.</p>

<p>'Ou, he's fu' weel; only gey girnie whiles wi'
his back-teeth,' glibly answered the urchin, throwing
aside his shyness when his precious charge had
become the subject.</p>

<p>'Dear me, Jockie,' laughed my friend, 'you will
have some trouble with him then?'</p>

<p>'Whiles,' soberly said the boy, who, although
conscious that the question was meant for banter,
seemed unable to restrain himself on a matter
evidently near his heart. 'He disna sleep weel,
an' I'm obliged to sit up at nicht an' whussle till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">{224}</a></span>
him; but he's guid, puir mannie, when the
fashious teeth are no troublin' him.'</p>

<p>We were much affected by the artless affection
which Jockie displayed towards his uncle; and
learned recently with pleasure that he had, through
the minister's good services, been appointed pupil-teacher
in what was formerly the parish school;
and that his nursling, hardier than the rest of the
family, was acquiring his first knowledge under
his nephew's affectionate tuition.</p>

<p>Without pleading ignorance of the evils frequently
attendant on the practice of intrusting
children with the care of infants, we prefer simply
to accept it as inevitable, and to contemplate the
advantages with which it is as undoubtedly
accompanied. In the first place, it is this early
discipline, this facing of the harder realities in their
lot from the outset, which could alone prepare
those in the humbler walks of life to tolerate the
position in which their maturer years will have to
be spent. The girl whom necessity has taught the
rudiments of housewifery simultaneously with her
alphabet, and the mysteries of nursing together with
the secret of making pot-hooks and hangers, will
blend most naturally and easily into the mistress of
a poor man's home, where the anxieties and solicitudes
common to women are indefinitely multiplied.
If not so palpable, the value to boys of the
knowledge of simple household duties is after all
scarcely less important; for aptitude in these is
perhaps the most efficacious weapon with which he
can enter the lists of a determinately arduous life.
In their acquirement the future workman has
been taught self-reliance and the habit of industry&mdash;qualities
on which his success mainly depends;
while he is specifically prepared for the not uncommon
eventuality&mdash;as soldier, sailor, or emigrant,
or even in the ordinary casualties of married life
in his own sphere&mdash;of having to minister to the
physical wants of himself and others. Nor in the
last of these situations will his juvenile experience
of 'minding the bairn' be without its useful
application; for at meal-times, in his evenings off
work, and even in the night-watches, he will be
called upon to accept his share in those solemn
rites which his domestic felicity has entailed.</p>

<p>There is a reflection too of a far higher character
to which the consideration of this simple theme
not inaptly gives rise. Solicitude for the welfare
of those whom they have cared for and protected
remains with the elder brothers and sisters in
greater or less force throughout life; and the
younger members of the family can never wholly
divest themselves of the confidence and respect
which such services have engendered. Each unit
in the tale of the poor man's family thus stands
to the other not merely in the fraternal, but, in
varying degrees, also in the filial relation. Hence
that wonderful tenacity of kindredship by which
they are distinguished. Diverging careers, conflicting
interests, petty jealousies, and even animosities,
may temporarily step in to arrest the
current of their affection; but the advent of
calamity or sorrow to one or other is a signal
which rarely fails to reunite them in bonds stronger
than ever. Is not blood, after all, thicker than
water, in their own idiomatic phrase? The successful
digger or colonial shepherd needs nothing
more transcendental than the memory of the
humble home in which all were mutually dependent,
to send his tenderest thoughts wandering
across the ocean which divides him from his playmates
and friends. Wherever their various lots
may be cast, there is to the end a common haunt
in which their loving spirits may meet, in the
'auld clay biggin' or 'humble cot' where each in
his turn performed his part in 'minding the bairn.'</p>

<p>The family affections are, moreover, the pith
and marrow of patriotism; and who will venture
to estimate the degree in which a nation's stability
is dependent upon the primitive economy of the
poor man's household? It is only by association
with the loves and sorrows and joys of his childhood
that the external surroundings of his home
become endeared to the heart of man. How naturally
Burns arises, in his <i>Cotter's Saturday Night</i>,
from the more immediate reflections which the
happiness of his humble characters suggests, to that
eloquent exclamation in praise of his native land,

<h2><a name="CAPTURING_OSTRICHES" id="CAPTURING_OSTRICHES">CAPTURING OSTRICHES.</a></h2>


<p>The greatest feat of an Arab hunter is to capture
an ostrich. Being very shy and cautious, and living
on the sandy plains, where there is little chance
to take it by surprise, it can be captured only by a
well-planned and long-continued pursuit on the
swiftest horse. The ostrich has two curious habits
in running when alarmed. It always starts with
outspread wings against the wind, so that it can
scent the approach of an enemy. Its sense of smell
is so keen that it can detect a person a great
distance long before he can be seen. The other
curious habit is that of running in a circle. Usually
five or six ostriches are found in company.
When discovered, part of the hunters, mounted
on fleet horses, will pursue the birds, while the
other hunters will gallop away at right angles to
the course the ostriches have taken. When these
hunters think they have gone far enough to cross
the path the birds will be likely to take, they
watch upon some rise of ground for their approach.
If the hunters hit the right place and see the
ostriches, they at once start in pursuit with fresh
horses, and sometimes they overtake one or two of
the birds; but often one or two of the fleet horses
fall, completely tired out with so sharp a chase.&mdash;<i>Newspaper
